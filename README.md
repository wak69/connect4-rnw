After completing the code (and losing my mind on tinycore), I installed Alpine, installed git and gcc on it so I can clone my repository and compile the code, and opened the file "/etc/inittab" that contains commands for startup used by the OpenRC service. Then I added the line "tty1::respawn:/bin/sh -lc 'exec /usr/local/bin/connect4' to open the game on the first terminal and restart it when it reaches the end. (I can also switch to a different terminal with Ctrl Alt F2 if I want to do something other than play the game). I'm never using tinycore again
