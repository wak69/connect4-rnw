After completing the code, we installed Alpine, installed git and gcc on it so we can clone the repository and compile the code, and opened the file "/etc/inittab" that contains commands for startup used by the OpenRC service. Then we added the line "tty1::respawn:/bin/sh -lc 'exec /usr/local/bin/connect4' to open the game on the first terminal and restart it when it reaches the end. (We can also switch to a different terminal with Ctrl Alt F2 if we want to do something other than play the game). The time complexity of the normal bot's decision is O(m(n + m))

The hard bot uses a minimax implementation to make its decision. It simulates all moves on the board and makes its decision based on which move gets the most score, and on the opponent's turns it simulates the most optimal move for the opponent, which is where the bot's score is minimized. The score is determines based on a function that assigns score based on how many pieces the bot has in a pattern, as well as how many pieces are in the center column to incentivize placing in the center. The runtime is O((7^d)nm)
